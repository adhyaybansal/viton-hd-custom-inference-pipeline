# viton-hd-custom-inference-pipeline
An end-to-end virtual try-on pipeline using the VITON-HD framework, integrated with U-2-Net for cloth mask generation, SCHP for human image parsing, and OpenPose for pose estimation. This notebook-driven project supports custom image inputs and outlines a step-by-step process to test VITON-HD on your own data.

# ðŸ‘• VITON-HD Custom Inference Pipeline

An end-to-end virtual try-on pipeline built using the **VITON-HD** model, integrated with:

- ðŸ§¥ **U-2-Net** for cloth mask generation  
- ðŸ‘¤ **SCHP** (Self-Correction Human Parsing) for human segmentation  
- ðŸ•º **OpenPose** for pose estimation (skeleton + keypoints)  
- ðŸ“¸ Custom image and clothing support for high-resolution virtual try-on

---

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1) Upload checkpoints data and test dataset  
2) Upload image and cloth in `datasets/test/image` and `datasets/test/cloth` directories in **768x1024** format with **white background**  
3) After cloning U-2-Net repo, make a directory `u2net` in `saved_models` directory and upload U-2-Net model in it  
4) Before running `simple_extractor.py`, upload LIP model in `models` directory  
5) Rest go with the flow, everything is mentioned in the `.ipynb`

## âœ… Notes

- Tested on Python 3.11.3 (for VITON-HD compatibility) , also created virtual environment and used Python 3.8 for SCHP
- Requires pretrained models:
  - VITON-HD checkpoints
  - U-2-Net model (`u2net.pth`)
  - LIP model for SCHP (`exp-schp-201908261155-lip.pth`)
  - OpenPose output (pose JSON and image)
- All image inputs must be **768x1024** and have **white backgrounds** for best results.
