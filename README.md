# viton-hd-custom-inference-pipeline
An end-to-end virtual try-on pipeline using the VITON-HD framework, integrated with U-2-Net for cloth mask generation, SCHP for human image parsing, and OpenPose for pose estimation. This notebook-driven project supports custom image inputs and outlines a step-by-step process to test VITON-HD on your own data.
